//  LIB.rs
//    by Lut99
//
//  Description:
//!   Defines the [`Loc`], a loving (but actually working) tribute to the
//!   now-deprecated `Span` from `ast-toolkit-span`.
//!
//!   # Rationale
//!   The main reason why `Span`s weren't working is that they were designed
//!   with two errors:
//!   - `Span`s carried source references in order to provide them at compile
//!     time (e.g., identifier names). This, while efficient, is actually
//!     absolutely HORRIBLE because it essentially prevents you to do any code
//!     generation.
//!   - `Span`s carried hard slices to source references so that there could be
//!     no confusion when they're generated to text. This is actually HORRIBLE,
//!     because the ENTIRE compiler is poluted with generics and lifetimes for
//!     a moment only occurring during error handling (which was screwed up
//!     too bc of the lifetimes). So yeah. Bad idea.
//!
//!   This will solve it by going for a more classic approach to source
//!   references: we just do it for debugging, so a [`Loc`] is just a location
//!   to a source text that can be printed in combination _with_ that source
//!   text.
//!
//!   This time, a lot of effort is being put into making them easy to work
//!   with during the bulk of the compiler. That is, any worry about there not
//!   being any location to point to or it being a merge of different sources
//!   is left internalized to the [`Loc`].

/// Representation of a contigious slice of source text.
///
/// It is the spiritual successor of a `Span`, which carries the same information but also
/// internalizes references to the source so that the area is actually accessible. This is not the
/// case for the Loc, which instead only becomes useful when combined with the original source
/// text.
///
/// Until then, the Loc provides the following while carrying it around:
/// - You can easily create new, (meaningless) Locs for e.g. code generation;
/// - You can easily compose them, whether they are from the same source or not; and
/// - They are cheap and easy to carry around. No [`Clone`]ing, no generics, no lifetimes!
///
/// # Comparing Locs
/// Note that [`Eq`], [`Hash`] and [`PartialEq`] are all implemented for Locs but do nothing (i.e.,
/// all Locs are reported to be the same). This to make e.g. deriving them on parent structs much easier.
